# Introduction

This chapter describes your completed junior seminar research project,
including the overall aims and the background motivating your research.
Whenever possible, you should use one or more concrete examples and
technical diagrams.

**Note for Junior Seminar**: This chapter should be approximately 5-7
pages in length. Focus on clearly articulating your research problem,
your approach, and why it matters. You don't need to provide exhaustive
detail - prioritize clarity and coherence over comprehensiveness.

It is often useful and necessary to separate the introduction into
multiple sections. Several possible sections are proposed below, you
can use these or distribute your introductory text into sections in
another way.

The headings below propose _one way_ you might structure this section
of the document.

## Motivation

## Current State of the Art

## Goals of the Project

## Ethical Implications

This document requires that you discuss the ethical implications of your
work -- no matter how benign you consider the outcome of your project.
As several major studies of ethical issues in computer science assert:
_no project is completely value-neutral_.

To assist you in elaborating on these issues, the following areas are
topics you might consider addressing. You do not need to address all of
them.

* Information Privacy
* Information Accuracy (e.g. can contain reliability)
* Potential Misuse (e.g. computer crime, unintended consequences)
* Second- or Third-Party Risk (e.g. safety)
* Data Collection Issues (e.g. issues inherent in collecting data)
* Algorithmic or Data Bias
* Potential Power Difference / Social Imbalance / Issues in Equity

In addition, reflect on ways that the above harms can be or are
mitigated by your work.
