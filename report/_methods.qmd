# Method of approach

This chapter answers the "how" question - how did you complete your
project, including the overall design of your study, details of the
algorithms and tools you have used, etc. Use technical diagrams,
equations, algorithms, and paragraphs of text to describe the research
that you have completed. Be sure to number all figures and tables and to
explicitly refer to them in your text.

**Note for Junior Seminar**: This chapter should be approximately 5-7
pages in length. Focus on the most important aspects of your
implementation. Include at least one technical diagram showing your
system architecture or workflow. Provide enough detail that someone could
understand and potentially replicate your work.

This chapter should contain:

* Description of your development environment and tools
* Key algorithms or data structures you implemented
* System architecture or design decisions
* Code snippets or pseudocode for critical components
* Technical diagrams illustrating your approach

For those projects whose implications address social or moral issues
(i.e. ethical standards, causes, effects), you will want to use this
section to describe how you actively mitigated or considered these
issues.
