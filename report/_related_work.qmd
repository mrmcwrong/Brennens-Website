This chapter includes a broad and detailed review of relevant existing
work. The literature review should provide background and context for
your junior seminar research project. The subsections may be organized
in whatever manner seems best suited to the material-- chronological, or
by topic, or according to some other criteria (e.g., primary versus
secondary resources).

**Note for Junior Seminar**: This chapter should be approximately 5-7
pages in length. Aim for 10-15 high-quality sources that directly relate
to your project. Focus on synthesizing the literature to show how your
work fits into the existing research landscape.

If ethical issues are central to this work, you should also address
historical and contemporary issues or efforts made to address them.
