## What is your research idea?

In this first journal entry, describe the problem you plan to investigate and
your initial approach. Please answer the following questions:

- What is the main problem or question you want to address?
There are too many spoilers in my trailers. I want to create an AI tool that uses plot summaries (and maybe potential plot summaries for unreleased films) in order to detect which scenes are likely to be spoilers. The tool would then skip those scenes.
- Why is this problem important or interesting?
I have had too many movies spoiled for me by trailers and no longer feel I can watch trailers in order to see if I would like a film. This is a problem faced by many every day.
- What is your initial approach to solving this problem?

- What tools, technologies, or methods do you plan to use?
- What do you hope to achieve or discover?
- What is one published research paper in your area?

Remember to be specific and provide concrete examples where possible. This entry
will serve as a foundation for your research project, so take time to think
through your ideas carefully and to document this in this journal entry.
