## What is your research idea?

In this first journal entry, describe the problem you plan to investigate and
your initial approach. Please answer the following questions:

- What is the main problem or question you want to address?

I (and many others) struggle to both begin and finish creative projects. This problem will be solved with an app that prompts users to perform bite-sized creative acts each day.

- Why is this problem important or interesting?

I want to be more motivated in creating content in general. I feel that I am a lazy person sometimes and I know people that believe the same about themselves, so I want to create a tool that can help people like me to see manageable tasks without feeling overwhelmed and begin creating content.

- What is your initial approach to solving this problem?

The app will give users a 1, 2, and 3 point prompt each day and the users choose which prompt they want to complete on the day. Users will then upload a photo, file, or text comment to the app and they will be awarded points for the day which will be tracked on the league table against robotic competitors. These competitors will dynamically adapt to the user's amount of creative output so that they will allow users who skip a day to get back in easier and also provide more of a challenge to more competitive users. The user's creative projects will be stored on their profile page.

- What tools, technologies, or methods do you plan to use?

I initially started coding with Swift and SwiftUI, but I have a Windows computer and I found it difficult to get Swift to function properly. I have switched to using Flutter and Dart because it offers cross-platform development and I can use it on my Windows computer.

- What do you hope to achieve or discover?

I hope to become better (and able) to build an app for iOS and Android using Flutter. I also hope to create an app that will allow users to be more creative generally and not feel overwhelmed by the prospect of starting a creative project.

- What is one published research paper in your area?
