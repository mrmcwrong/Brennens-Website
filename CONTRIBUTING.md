# Junior Seminar Research Project for Allegheny College CIS

## Introduction

This repository contains the starter for the Junior Seminar Research Report
document. This document compiles using GitHub Actions. The template contains
more specific details about its use. The remainder of this `CONTRIBUTING` file
provides an overview of the project's requirements and the process of publishing
the research journal and releasing a research report via GitHub Actions. Please
see the course syllabus for more details about the course or the assessment
requirements.

## Overview

This assignment requires a researcher to write a Markdown and LaTeX
document, stored in the file `report/index.qmd` and one of the
"underscore files" for the junior seminar research report chapters (e.g.,
`report/_introduction.qmd` or `report/_related_work.qmd`) that describes
the key aspects of a junior seminar research project. Please refer to the
source code in these files for an explanation of the components of a
junior seminar research report and the way in which you create them in
Markdown and/or LaTeX.

Your course instructor will reduce a researcher's grade for this
assignment if the PDF of your completed research report has not been
properly released before the assignment's due date as specified in the
GitHub Classroom page when you accept this assignment. Unless you provide
the course instructor with documentation of the extenuating circumstances
that you are facing, no late work will be considered towards your grade
for this project. Each researcher is responsible for creating their own GitHub
repositories for their prototype tool(s) and data sets. For each external
repository that you create, please make sure to provide a reference to it
inside of your research report and confirm that the course instructor can
access it if you have decided not to make it public.

## Requirements

For specific details about the general evaluation rubric for _minimum
requirements_ please refer to the course syllabus. Please note that your junior
seminar research report chapters will be evaluated according to the baseline
requirements outlined in this document. Finally, please note that these are only
baseline requirements and it is expected that an exceptional junior seminar
research report will exceed these requirements.

Please consult the following sub-sections, as section requirements may have
changed from requirements in previous years. All descriptions of each section
are delimited by the understanding that sections should "include, but not be
limited to" the areas highlighted. It is also important to note that students
may, with the consent of their instructor, modify the structure of their junior
seminar research report so that it includes, for instance, different chapters or
different ordering of chapters. With that said, the final junior seminar
research report that a student submits must still meet all the baseline
requirements outlined in the course syllabus.

Also keep in mind that the typical instruction to "whenever possible, use and
describe one or more concrete examples and technical diagrams" applies across
_all_ relevant chapters listed below.

A final note about requirements: nearly all chapters request some discussion of
ethical implications inherent in projects. The ways in which ethical issues
impact research will vary from project to project. Your instructor will be able
to guide you on a project-by-project basis toward responding to the ethics
requirements listed below.

### Chapter Length Requirements

Each chapter of your junior seminar research report should be
approximately **5 to 7 pages** in length. This is different from a senior
research project, where chapters are typically 10 to 15 pages. The
reduced length allows you to focus on the key aspects of your research
while still demonstrating thorough understanding and analysis.

### Highlights of Research Report Requirements

The following lists of requirements describe the general _shape_, and some of
the fundamental specifics of what each chapter entails. Meeting the following
requirements ensures a _passing_ grade, and not necessarily anything above that
watermark. Please review the course syllabus for more details about the specific
baseline requirements for each chapter. The purpose of the content in these
lists is to use "action words" to highlight the key "tasks" that each chapter
should accomplish as a part of the entire junior seminar research report.

#### Introduction Section Requirements

- **States** the problem addressed in this research
- **Overviews** the project's aims and objectives
- **Summarizes** the background motivating your research
- **Highlights** the key contributions of the project
- **Highlights** the ethical issues implied by the current state of the problem
  underlying the work

#### Related Work Requirements

- **Reviews** the relevant existing work (i.e., the "literature review")
- **Furnishes** a concise, scholarly review of the literature explaining
  the background to the proposed research
- **Provides** the context for the aims of the research in relation to
  existing work on the topic
- **Places** the junior seminar research in the context of the relevant
  existing work
- **Connects** to the ethical discussions referenced in the
  `Introduction`

#### Method Section Requirements

- **Describes** the infrastructure and tools implemented to serve, test, and
  support research and conduct experiments
- **Enumerates** the general processes and code used by the project with
  required technical content that would include, for instance, diagrams and/or
  code snippets and/or algorithm statements
- **Addresses** the interventions that the research incorporates or develops to
  address ethical concerns in datasets, software processes, or theoretical
  approaches

#### Experimental Results Requirements

- **Displays and discusses** evaluative metrics and data used as validation
  strategies the projects
- **Defines** the thresholds for success, and discusses the outcomes of
  experiments relative to them
- **Explores** the trade-offs evident in the experimental results, leverages
  previously defined metrics about, for instance, efficiency and/or effectiveness
- **Uses** techniques such as statistics and/or data visualizations to highlight
  the key trends in the experimental results
- **Discusses** any threats to validity that remain from the original summary of
  the research or those introduced by any approaches or data used in the these
  research and implementation process

#### Conclusion and Future Work Requirements

- **Summarizes** your research and experimental outcomes proposes
- **Proposes**, where applicable, future areas of work or research indicated by
  the conclusion of this research
- **Furnishes** an evidence- or results-based appraisal of ethical issues left
  unresolved or created by this research

### Gauging Your Level of Achievement

With a task such as this, defining _precisely_ what constitutes exceptional or
above-average work is difficult, as each project is distinct and is only
comparable to its own potential. Bearing in mind that the title of this
subsection uses the word "Gauging", the following lists can help you to see what
your achievement may look like in any of the following scenarios.

### Exceptional work (i.e., A- and upward)

Exceptional projects share the following features:

- the research report is _comprehensive_, with well-developed chapters that
  thoroughly explore the research topic (each chapter 7+ pages)
- the report displays a clear grasp of the relevant literature (engaging `15`+
  sources of high disciplinary quality)
- discussion of ethical and technical imperatives occur throughout the chapters,
  often reinforcing or relating to prior topics of discussion in the introduction
  and/or related work
- the project discusses, coordinates, and relates sources to each other in both
  complementary and contradictory ways, often highlighting or at least attempting
  to resolve conflicts where they arise
- the methodology behind the project is clear, often using multiple diagrams to
  discuss structure and relationships of the various parts of the related artifact
- experiments show sound methods that, even if generating unsupportive data, are
  discussed with critical reflection and clear demonstration of opportunities,
  faults, and/or successes with reference to how this changed/changes the project
  as a whole
- future work clearly grapples with the tasks left undone and the project's
  impact on the larger computational communities in which it participates

### Above average work (B- to B+)

Above average projects may be described as:

- _solid_, with chapters meeting the 5-7 page target and demonstrating good
  understanding of the research topic
- displaying a grasp of much, but not all, relevant literature (engaging `10`+
  sources of moderate disciplinary quality or authority)
- discussion of ethical and technical imperatives occur in more than one or two
  chapters, but may remain unresolved or unaddressed
- the project discusses, coordinates, and relates sources to each other without
  necessarily recognizing conflicts or areas of contradiction
- the methodology behind the project is clear, though there remain some
  questions about project operations, security, or design
- experiments demonstrate effort in developing results, though the conversation
  around them does not provide reflective inquiry into faults or successes and
  their causes/effects
- future work names and discusses tasks remaining undone and the ethical issues
  raised by the research, but does not suggest how these relate to the larger
  communities in which the project traffics

### Average work (C- to C+)

Average projects often fulfill the requirements above, but stop at having
completed the technical distinctions the project asks for in its specifications.
Chapters meet minimum page requirements (5 pages) but may lack depth or thorough
analysis.

### Below-average work (D to D+)

Below-average projects miss key requirements and are often under the minimum
page count (less than 5 pages per chapter), feature fewer sources than are
required and otherwise do not fulfill a reasonable portion of the tasks defined.
Sources are low-quality and often look more like tutorials than higher-level
disciplinary discussion. Projects falling into this category fulfill 60% - 75%
of the requirements.

### Failing work (F)

Failing projects lack entire chapters or provide very minimal attempts to
complete them. Sources are low-quality and/or are missing. Multiple requirements
(on the order of 50% or more) are not fulfilled. Writing is cursory and not
descriptive; may include many instances of generalization and no evidence.
